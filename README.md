# CNTF - Main

## Purpose
This source code repository deploys the AWS infrastructure and applications (5G core & test suite) for CNTF

## Deployment
Prerequisites:

* *Please ensure that you have configured the AWS CLI to authenticate to an AWS environment where you have adequate permissions to create an EKS cluster, security groups and IAM roles*: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-quickstart.html
* *Please ensure that this branch has been deployed before deploying other CNTF branches, as this ensures that the cluster and other necessary AWS infrastructure are available to support the execution of scripts in other repositories.*  

Steps:
1. Mirror this repository in Gitlab or connect this repository externally to Gitlab 
2. Authenticate Gitlab with AWS: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/cloud_deployment/
3. In Gitlab, click the drop-down arrow next to "Build" and select "Pipelines"
4. In the top right hand corner select "Run Pipeline"
5. In the drop-down under "Run for branch name or tag" select the appropriate name for this branch and click "Run Pipeline"
6. Once again, click the drop-down arrow next to "Build" and select "Pipelines", you should now see the pipeline being executed
